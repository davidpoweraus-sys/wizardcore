Ethical Guidelines
Golden Rules:

    Never test systems you don't own or have explicit permission to test

    Document everything - methodologies, findings, disclosures

    Responsible disclosure - give vendors time to patch

Portfolio Requirements:

    10+ working exploits (various difficulty)

    2+ tools released as open source

    1+ responsible disclosure with CVE

    Blog/writeup demonstrating deep understanding

Instructor Guidance
Teaching Philosophy:

    Show, don't just tell - live demonstrations are crucial

    Break it first, then fix it - understanding through breaking

    Answer "why" not just "how" - deep understanding

    Encourage experimentation - safe failure is learning

    Connect to real-world - case studies of actual exploits

Common Pitfalls to Address:

    Students trying to run before they can walk (skipping fundamentals)

    Getting stuck in "tool dependency" without understanding

    Frustration with debugging - teach persistence

    Ethical boundaries - reinforce constantly

    Imposter syndrome - celebrate small victories

Conclusion

This curriculum provides a comprehensive path from beginner to advanced exploit developer. The journey is challenging but immensely rewarding, developing not just technical skills but also critical thinking, persistence, and ethical responsibility.

Remember: The goal is not to create malicious actors, but to develop the expertise needed to defend against the most sophisticated attacks. With great power comes great responsibility - use this knowledge to make the digital world safer for everyone.
